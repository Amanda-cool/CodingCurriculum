# CodingCurriculum
Base curriculum for the ITA and R2H Tech programs

All assignments will be given in the https://github.com/Code2Hire/CodingCurriculum repo and are due on Mondays at noon.

Do not clone this repo! Fork it! This will create your own personal copy that won't impact the original repo. Instructions are located at https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo.

Make sure you follow step 3 in that article and keep your forked repo up-to-date with the original.
