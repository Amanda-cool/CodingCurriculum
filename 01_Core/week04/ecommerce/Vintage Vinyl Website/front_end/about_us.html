                <p>VRP Vinyl started out as the gig of a lifetime collectively fantasized about by three high
                    school buddies. It is the culmination of deciding they each had far too many records at
                    home, followed by tens of thousands of cups of coffee ruminating on that fact, then finding
                    the perfect space to showcase all of those records and finally calling it “VRP”, which is
                    the only place they saw their lives finishing, The Vinyl Resting Place. Which in turn led
                    them to finding out the difference between acronym and initialism but nevermind that...</p>
                <p>Opened in May of 2018, VRP Vinyl is located at the easternmost end of historic 6th street in
                    Austin. Specializing in used and collectible records, with a heavy concentration on 60's and
                    70's pop, psych, garage, prog, etc. Other strong areas of interest include 50's and 60's
                    jazz, lounge and exotica, 60's soul and as many records we can gather from the dismal vinyl
                    production era of the mid to late 90's and early 2000’s, with special attention to the
                    post-Nirvana alternative rock boom. We’ve started to phase in some carefully curated
                    contemporary and local artists for the kids and locavores.</p>
